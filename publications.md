## Working papers
* **Quantification of occupational gender stereotypes between 1900 and 1999 in Japan**

This project aims to quantify 100 years of gender stereotypes in Japan. By utilizing the large amount of data offered by the Japanese National Diet Library, we train word embeddings for each year to 
measure people's stereotypes. While word embeddings are increasingly used to measure historical stereotypes, most studies use English data. We examine whether we can replicate similar results in Japanese or uncover 
any limitations.
