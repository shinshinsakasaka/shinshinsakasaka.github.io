## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">

Hi! I am an incoming PhD student in Informatics at Indiana University Bloomington, where I will be advised by Prof. [Haewoon Kwak](https://haewoon.io/) and Prof. [Jisun An](https://jisun.me/) at [Soda Lab](https://soda-labo.github.io/). I have also worked as a research intern at [CRAI-CIS lab](https://crai-cis.aalto.fi/), Aalto University.

You can download my CV [here](CV.pdf)

## Research Interest

I’m broadly interested in natural language processing, computational social science, cultural analytics, AI bias and AI ethics. Combining these interests and my cultural background, I am especially curious about,
* how AI shapes culture and culture shapes AI through training data, algorithms, and designs
* using and developing computational methods to better answer questions in social science disciplines

## Current Research Projects
* **Quantification of occupational gender stereotypes in Japan between 1900 and 1999**

This project aims to quantify 100 years of occupational gender stereotypes in Japan. By utilizing the large amount of data offered by the Japanese National Diet Library, we train word embeddings for each year to measure people's stereotypes. While word embeddings are increasingly used to measure historical stereotypes, most studies use English data. We examine whether we can replicate similar results in Japanese or uncover any limitations.

## Experience

* The Cornell, Maryland, Max Planck Pre-doctoral Research School 2022. August 2022. [link](https://cmmrs2022.mpi-sws.org/)  
It was a great opportunity to attend lectures on cutting-edge computer science research and interact with inspiring faculties and peers.

* Research Intern at [CRAI-CIS lab](https://crai-cis.aalto.fi/), Aalto Universiy. May – July 2022.  
Project: Civic Agency in AI? Democratizing Algorithmic Services in the City (CAAI).  
I analyzed feedback from organizations on the AI Act proposal and found how words used in the feedbacks vary by organization types.

* Exchange program at St John's College, University of Cambridge. February 2019.
