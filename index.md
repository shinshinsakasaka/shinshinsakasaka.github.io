## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile_2.jpg">

Hi! I am an incoming PhD student in Informatics at Indiana University Bloomington, where I will be advised by Prof. [Haewoon Kwak](https://haewoon.io/) and Prof. [Jisun An](https://jisun.me/) at [Soda Lab](https://soda-labo.github.io/). I have also worked as a research intern at [CRAI-CIS lab](https://crai-cis.aalto.fi/), Aalto University.

You can download my CV [here](CV.pdf)

## Research Interest

I’m broadly interested in natural language processing, computational social science, social psychology, AI bias and AI ethics. Combining these interests, I am especially curious about,
* how AI shapes culture and culture shapes AI through training data, algorithms, and designs
* using and developing computational methods to better answer questions in social science disciplines

## Experience

* The Cornell, Maryland, Max Planck Pre-doctoral Research School 2022. August 2022. [link](https://cmmrs2022.mpi-sws.org/)  
It was a great opportunity to attend lectures on cutting-edge computer science research and interact with inspiring faculties and peers.

* Research Intern at [CRAI-CIS lab](https://crai-cis.aalto.fi/), Aalto Universiy. May – July 2022.  
Project: Civic Agency in AI? Democratizing Algorithmic Services in the City (CAAI).  
I analyzed feedback from organizations on the AI Act proposal and found how words used in the feedbacks vary by organization types.

* Exchange program at St John's College, University of Cambridge. February 2019.
