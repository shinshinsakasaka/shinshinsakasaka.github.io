## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">

Hello! I am a master's student majoring in information science at Nagoya University, Japan. I have also worked as a research intern at [CRAI-CIS lab](https://crai-cis.aalto.fi/), Aalto Universiy.

You can download my CV [here](CV_online.pdf)

## Research Interest

I’m broadly interested in natural language processing, computational social science, cultural analytics, AI bias and AI ethics. Combining these interests and my cultural background, I am especially curious about,
* how AI shape culture and culture shapes AI through training data, algorithms, and designs
* developing computational methods to better answer questions in social science disciplines
* using computational methods to answer questions in social science disciplines
