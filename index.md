## Research Interests

I’m broadly interested in natural language processing, computational social science, social psychology, AI bias, and AI ethics. Combining these interests, my main research interests are
* Understanding how AI shapes culture and culture shapes AI through training data, algorithms, and designs
* Using and developing computational methods to better answer questions in social science disciplines
