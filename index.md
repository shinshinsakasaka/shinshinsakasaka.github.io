<img class="profile-picture" src="profile_2.jpg">

Hi! I am an incoming PhD student in Informatics at Indiana University Bloomington, where I will be advised by Prof. [Haewoon Kwak](https://haewoon.io/) and Prof. [Jisun An](https://jisun.me/) at the [Soda Lab](https://soda-labo.github.io/). I have also worked as a research intern at [CRAI-CIS lab](https://crai-cis.aalto.fi/), Aalto University. I attended the [CMMRS 2022](https://cmmrs2022.mpi-sws.org/).

You can download my CV [here](CV.pdf)

## Research Interests

I’m broadly interested in natural language processing, computational social science, social psychology, AI bias and AI ethics. Combining these interests, my main research interests are twofold.
* Understanding how AI shapes culture and culture shapes AI through training data, algorithms, and designs
* Using and developing computational methods to better answer questions in social science disciplines
